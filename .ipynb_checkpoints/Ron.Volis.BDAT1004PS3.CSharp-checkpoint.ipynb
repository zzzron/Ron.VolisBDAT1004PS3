    "## Question 1 C#\n",
    "A Data Programming professor has a class of students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, he\n",
    "decides to cancel class if fewer than some number of students are present when class starts.\n",
    "Arrival times go from on time (𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 ≤ 0) to arrived late (𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 > 0).\n",
    "Given the arrival time of each student and a threshold number of attendees, determine if the class\n",
    "is canceled.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of input contains t, the number of test cases.\n",
    "Each test case consists of two lines.\n",
    "The first line has two space-separated integers, n and k, the number of students (size of a) and\n",
    "the cancellation threshold.\n",
    "The second line contains n space-separated integers (𝑎[1], 𝑎[2], … 𝑎[𝑛]) describing the arrival\n",
    "times for each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Non-positive arrival times (𝑎[𝑖] ≤ 0)) indicate the student arrived early or on time;\n",
    "positive arrival times (𝑎[𝑖] > 0) indicate the student arrived minutes late.\n",
    "For example, there are n = 6 students who arrive at times 𝑎 = [−1, −1,0,0,1,1]. Four are there\n",
    "on time, and two arrive late. If there must be k = 4 for class to go on, in this case the class will\n",
    "continue. If there must be k = 5, then class is cancelled.\n",

    "##### Function Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the angryProfessor function in the editor below. It must return YES if class is\n",
    "cancelled, or NO otherwise.\n",
    "angryProfessor has the following parameter(s):\n",
    "• k: the threshold number of students\n",
    "• a: an array of integers representing arrival times\n",
